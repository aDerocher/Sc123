Can Not Assume:
 - years will always be 4 digits (97' Chevrolets)
 - years will always contain a 1 or a 2 like 1800'-2999' (97' Chevrolets)

Can probably assume:
 - years will always be at the start or end of the name (no one would do 'Alpha 2004 Romeo')
 - last letter of string will only be a pluralizing 's' if the year is at the front (becuase you wouldn't say Ferarri 2004's or Mustang 2004's, you would list '2018 Volkswagons' or '1999 Hondas')
