# Code Challenges

This directory should contain three files:

- contacts.csv
- contacts-requests.php
- this readme
- sorting.php

The challenges are explained in `contacts-requests.php` and `sorting.php`.

Please don't send us plagiarized code. That's a disqualifier. We use code challenges to assess how you think through a problem and craft a communicable solution. Submitting plagiarized code doesn't allow us to do that, and robs you of the opportunity to express your capabilities. Thanks in advance.


# Experience Log

1. Solving Problem 1 (2.5 hours)
   - I started out trying to really challenge myself and only use the official PHP documentation. I made some progress, but realized this was too high level of a problem to work on with my small base knowledge of PHP.
2. Solving Problem 1 (Part II) (4 hours).
   - I found this puzzle pretty intreuiging, and I knew I could solve it. So I decided to try to complete it using Javascript. I think I spent probably 4 hours coding it out and have a 75% working solution. I know I could fix it (and refactor it) but since this wasn't the explicit ask I decided I needed to move on to the next portion.
3. Solving Problem 2 (3 hours)
   - This part was really challenging as I'm less confident on backend structures. This time I broadened my research materials to web3schools and youtube. I think I struggled with the ask a bit, as I wasn't sure if this was supposed to just mock a server by making calls to the other file, or If I'm actually supposed to create and run a local database and make calls to it.
   - Either way, this is the first time I've used any PHP backend. Much like problem 1, I would be very interested to see what a working solution looked like.
